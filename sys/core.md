# Core Rules

## Basic Resolution
Most actions are resolved by rolling a twenty-sided die (d20), adding appropriate bonuses and penalties, and comparing the sum against another number. Bonuses and penalties include but are not limited to ability modifiers, skill ranks, luck, magic, and circumstance.

## Checks
Checks are divided into two types: active contest and passive contest. Active contests are checks where both the aggressor and defender roll a check. Passive contests only have the aggressor roll.
