# Core Rules

## Characters

### Attributes
Basic values defining the raw character. Includes Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. One of these will be a part of most checks.

## Checks
Everyone has their own ideas on what they want to happen. When there's disagreement or a chance of failure, then the players must check the values defining their character and roll to see if they succeed or fail. Sometimes by what degree.

### Basic Resolution
Most actions are resolved by rolling a twenty-sided die, adding appropriate bonuses and penalties, and comparing the sum against another number. Bonuses and penalties include but are not limited to ability modifiers, skill ranks, luck, magic, and circumstance.

### Basic Types
Checks are primarily divided into two types: active and passive. Active checks are checks where both the aggressor and defender roll. Passive checks only have the aggressor roll. Defenders in passive contests rely on fixed values. Referencing fixed values and comparing them is not a check, though a GM may choose to do this for rapid resolution of tasks deemed mundane.
