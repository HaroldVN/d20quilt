# Core Rules
The necessary rules to understand the game and play.

## Characters

### Attributes
Basic values defining the raw character. Includes Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. At least one of these will be a part of all checks.

## Checks
Everyone has their own ideas on what they want to happen. When there's disagreement or a chance of failure, the players must check the values defining their character and roll to see if they succeed or fail. Sometimes by what degree.

### Basic Resolution
Most actions are resolved by rolling a twenty-sided die, adding appropriate bonuses and penalties, and comparing the sum against another number. Bonuses and penalties include but are not limited to ability modifiers, skill ranks, luck, magic, and circumstance.

### Basic Types
Checks are divided into two types: active resistance and passive resistance. Active resistance checks are checks where both the aggressor and defender roll. Passive resistance checks only have the aggressor roll. Defenders in passive resistance checks rely on fixed values. Referencing fixed values and comparing them is not a check, though a GM may choose to do this for rapid resolution of tasks deemed mundane.

Imagine two people playing hide and seek. This is an example of an active resistance check. Both know that the other exists and they try to outdo the other. Compare this to security on the look-out for someone wanted. They do not know if the suspect is nearby, but still maintain vigilance. This is an example of a passive resistance check. Likewise, a security system searching for a suspect would also be a passive resistance check.
